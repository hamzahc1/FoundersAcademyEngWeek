# FoundersAcademyEngWeek
Syllabus Material for Founders Academy Engineering Week

This syllabus covers 3 separate projects that represent typical jobs software engineers may have to complete.


## Project 1 

In this project, we will build a website for our web application (which we'll get to later this week). We start by using HTML, CSS and more advanced libraries to create a multi-page website, and we'll host it live using Github. 


## Project 2 

In this project, we will build a data API that will help us store, retrieve and delete posts from our journal. It will be built in Python, using a framework called Flask. We will deploy our API using https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ , which will allow us to publicly deploy our API to be called.
